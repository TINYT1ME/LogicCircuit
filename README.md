## ‚ùì How To Use

### Creating Components

-   **Logic Gates**: Select the desired logic gate type from the options at the bottom of the screen. Left-click anywhere on the canvas to place it.
-   **Switches**: Click the green "+Switch" button, then left-click on the canvas to place it.
-   **LEDs**: Click the green "+LED" button, then left-click on the canvas to place it.
-   **Wires**:
    1.  Left-click on the output square of a gate.
    2.  Move the mouse to create wire bends, clicking at each bend point.
    3.  Connect the wire by left-clicking on the input square of another gate or LED.

### Deleting Components

-   **Logic Gates**: Right-click on the gate to delete it.
-   **Switches**: Click the red "-Switch" button, then select the switch you want to remove.
-   **LEDs**: Click the red "-LED" button, then select the LED you want to remove.
-   **Wires**: Wires are automatically deleted when the connected gate, switch, or LED is removed.

### Modifying Components

-   **Switches**: Right-click on a switch to toggle its state.
-   **Logic Gates and LEDs**: These components are static and cannot be modified once placed.

### Working with Wires

-   **Creating Bends**: To adjust wire paths, click at desired points on the canvas while drawing a wire.
-   **Connecting Wires**: Ensure wires are connected to the correct input and output squares for proper circuit functionality.
